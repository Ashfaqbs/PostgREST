# PostgREST

PostgREST is an open-source tool that automatically transforms our PostgreSQL database into a fully functional RESTful API. It leverages our database schema, relationships, and stored procedures to expose data as HTTP endpoints—eliminating the need to write a separate backend for CRUD operations.

## What is PostgREST?

PostgREST takes a PostgreSQL database and converts it into an API. It exposes tables, views, and functions as endpoints, allowing clients to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data directly through HTTP requests.

## Why Use PostgREST?

- **Rapid API Development:** Generate an API instantly from our existing database schema without writing additional code.
- **High Performance:** By translating HTTP requests into efficient SQL queries, it utilizes PostgreSQL’s query optimizer for high throughput.
- **Simplicity:** Minimal configuration is required. we focus on our database design while PostgREST handles the API layer.
- **Security and Control:** Leverage PostgreSQL’s robust role-based access control. Configure permissions directly in our database to secure our endpoints.

## How Does PostgREST Work?

- **Schema-Driven Endpoints:** Endpoints are auto-generated based on our database schema (tables, views, functions) and the foreign key relationships between them.
- **HTTP to SQL Mapping:** HTTP requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) are mapped to corresponding SQL queries. For example, a GET request to `/employee` retrieves rows from the `employee` table.
- **Resource Embedding:** Automatically embed related data using foreign key relationships. This allows we to fetch nested resources in a single request.
- **Custom RPC:** Define PostgreSQL (Stored Procedures For DDL , DML , Custom SQL)functions (RPC) to execute complex business logic or custom queries, which are then exposed as API endpoints.

## When to Use PostgREST

- **Data-Driven Applications:** Ideal for applications where the business logic primarily resides in the database.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly expose a database as an API without the overhead of writing custom server-side code.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Serve as a lightweight, standalone API layer that can be deployed independently.
- **Internal Tools and Dashboards:** Perfect for administrative interfaces or internal tools where quick access to data is crucial.

## Things to Know Before Using PostgREST

- **Database-First Approach:** when our API is entirely driven by our PostgreSQL schema. A well-designed schema is critical.
- **Security Considerations:** Since the API directly reflects our database, ensure that roles and permissions are properly configured. Limit exposure of sensitive data by carefully managing user roles.
- **Limitations:** PostgREST is excellent for CRUD operations and simple queries. More complex business logic might require additional custom backend services.
- **Configuration Options:** Familiarize with settings such as connection pooling, timeouts, and request logging.
- **Version Compatibility:** Ensure PostgreSQL version is compatible with the PostgREST version we intend to use.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Using Docker
Pull the official image and run PostgREST by configuring environment variables:
```bash
docker pull postgrest/postgrest
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e PGRST_DB_URI="postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname" \
  -e PGRST_DB_SCHEMA="public" \
  -e PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE="anon" \
  postgrest/postgrest
```


Replace the environment variable values with our actual database connection details.

#### Native Installation
Follow the instructions in the [official PostgREST documentation](https://postgrest.org/) to build and install the tool on our system.

### Configuration

- **Environment Variables:** Configure the database connection (`PGRST_DB_URI`), schema (`PGRST_DB_SCHEMA`), and access role (`PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE`).
- **Docker Compose:** For production or multi-container setups, consider using Docker Compose to manage our PostgREST service alongside other services.

### Example API Usage

- **Basic Read:**  
  `GET http://localhost:3000/employee`  
  Returns all rows from the `employee` table.
  
- **Resource Embedding:**  
  `GET http://localhost:3000/employee?select=id,emp_code,name,employee_skills(skill)`  
  Returns employee details along with an embedded list of skills (provided a foreign key relationship exists).

- **Custom RPC:**  
  Define PostgreSQL functions for custom queries and call them via:  
  `POST http://localhost:3000/rpc/run_query`

## Best Practices

- **Security:** Use role-based access controls and HTTPS to secure our API. Restrict anonymous access if needed.
- **Database Optimization:** Index frequently queried fields and regularly maintain our database (e.g., VACUUM, ANALYZE) for optimal performance.
- **Documentation:** Utilize the automatically generated OpenAPI (Swagger) specification to document our API.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test endpoints, especially when using custom RPC functions or exposing complex joins and filters.
