Below is a detailed explanation of connection pooling, timeouts, and request logging in PostgREST, including what each one is, how they can be configured (via configuration files or environment variables), and sample configurations.

## 1. Connection Pooling

**What is it?**  
Connection pooling allows PostgREST to reuse a set of pre-established database connections instead of opening a new connection for every incoming request. This reduces connection overhead and improves performance.

**How to Configure Connection Pooling:**

- **Via Configuration File (postgrest.conf):**

  ```ini
  db-uri = "postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname"
  db-schema = "public"
  db-anon-role = "anon"
  
  # Number of connections in the pool (default is typically 10)
  db-pool = 10
  ```

- **Via Environment Variables:**

  ```bash
  export PGRST_DB_URI="postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname"
  export PGRST_DB_SCHEMA="public"
  export PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE="anon"
  export PGRST_DB_POOL=10
  
  # Then run PostgREST with our configuration file or directly if using environment variables.
  postgrest postgrest.conf
  ```

## 2. Timeouts

**What are they?**  
Timeouts are safeguards to prevent long-running operations from consuming system resources indefinitely. In PostgREST, timeouts can be applied both at the connection pool level and within PostgreSQL itself for query execution.

### Types of Timeouts & Configuration

### A. Connection Pool Acquisition Timeout

- **What it does:**  
  This setting determines how long PostgREST will wait for an available connection from the pool before timing out.

- **Configuration Options:**

  - **Via Configuration File:**
    ```ini
    # Timeout in milliseconds (e.g., 10000 ms = 10 seconds)
    db-pool-acquisition-timeout = 10000
    ```

  - **Via Environment Variable:**
    ```bash
    export PGRST_DB_POOL_ACQUISITION_TIMEOUT=10000
    ```

### B. Statement Timeout (At the PostgreSQL Level)

- **What it does:**  
  It limits the maximum duration a query is allowed to run. This is set within PostgreSQL and can be applied per role or per session.

- **Configuration Example (Role-Level):**

  ```sql
  -- Connect to PostgreSQL and run:
  ALTER ROLE anon SET statement_timeout TO '5s';
  ```

  This configuration ensures that any query executed using the `anon` role will automatically be terminated if it runs longer than 5 seconds.

## 3. Request Logging

**What is it?**  
Request logging captures details about API requests, responses, and errors. This information is crucial for monitoring, debugging, and auditing the API's behavior.

**How to Configure Request Logging:**

### A. Log Level

- **What it does:**  
  Controls the verbosity of the logs. Options typically include:
  
  - `error`: Only errors are logged.
  - `warn`: Warnings and errors are logged.
  - `info`: Informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged.
  - `debug`: Detailed debug information, plus all of the above.

- **Configuration Options:**

  - **Via Configuration File:**
    ```ini
    log-level = "info"
    ```

  - **Via Environment Variable:**
    ```bash
    export PGRST_LOG_LEVEL=info
    ```

### B. Log Format

- **What it does:**  
  Specifies the output format of logs, making it easier to integrate with log management systems.
  
  - **Common options:**
    - `json`: Structured JSON format (ideal for centralized logging).
    - `text`: Plain text format.

- **Configuration Options:**

  - **Via Configuration File:**
    ```ini
    log-format = "json"
    ```

  - **Via Environment Variable:**
    ```bash
    export PGRST_LOG_FORMAT=json
    ```

## Summary

- **Connection Pooling:**  
  Reuses a fixed set of database connections for efficiency. Configure via `db-pool`.

- **Timeouts:**  
  Prevents indefinite waiting for connections or excessively long-running queries. Configure using `db-pool-acquisition-timeout` for the connection pool and PostgreSQLâ€™s `statement_timeout` for queries.

- **Request Logging:**  
  Provides insights into API activity. Configure with `log-level` and `log-format` to suit our monitoring needs.
